# Eat-sy — Frontend

This project was generated with [Vite] and [React].

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you could not customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the ESLint linter to check for code quality and style issues in your project.

### `npm run format`

Formats the codebase using the configured code formatter.

### `npm run analyze`

Analyzes the production build bundle size.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to a hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Heroku, etc.).

## Code scaffolding

You can generate new components, modules, and other code structures using various scripts or libraries. Some common examples include:

- `npx create-react-app my-app`: Generates a new React project using Create React App.
- `npm run generate component ComponentName`: Generates a new component with the specified name.
- `npm run generate container ContainerName`: Generates a new container (smart component) with the specified name.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test`
